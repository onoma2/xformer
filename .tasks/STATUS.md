# Task Board
_Updated: 2026-05-24 (Stochastic: slot-keyed cache landed; NewR/NewM domain isolation closed; Slide / Legato / cluster-tail Generate pitch moved to cache-pick under their owning seed; jump octave drift resets on melody renew; cycle-end hooks bundled so Jump/Sleep/Patience/Mutate all advance on the same boundary; comment audit pass on engine layer.)_

## 🟢 generator-preview-apply — Generator A/B preview, step selection, 64-step context, Tuesday AlgoGenerator
**Status:** done — Phases A-F complete and hardware verified.
**Where I stopped:** All phases committed. SequenceBuilder 3-copy state machine, RandomGenerator enhancements, GeneratorPage A/B workflow, 64-step bank visualization, context menu expansion, and Tuesday AlgoGenerator (15 algorithms via TuesdayAlgoCore). RAM: `.data + .bss = 118,884` (92.9%).
**Next action:** Merge `feat/generator` to master when user confirms.
**Depends on:** nothing
**Branch:** feat/generator

## 🟡 stochastic-track-port — Domain isolation + cache-pick refactor landed
**Status:** Cache cells are now slot-keyed: cells[K] is a pure function of (seed, events, K). First / window edits no longer perturb cell content. Anchor melody is keyed per slot by melodySeed, so NewR cannot shift pitches; cluster-tail Generate-mode pitch and Slide both moved to melodySeed too (closes the rhythm→melody cross-domain leak). Legato moved off the stored event bit into a cache-pick under cellRng; Slide rolled by a separate melody-keyed RNG with its own salt. Jump octave register zeroes on NewM / refreshLoopSources / patience-driven melody regen. Cycle-end hooks (jump, sleep, patience-R, patience-M, mutate) bundled into `rollCycleEndHooks()` and fired from both natural pattern wrap and preempted reset-measure so they all stay in lockstep. Comment audit pass cleaned engine layer (cache, generator, engine + headers); long phase-tagged blocks compressed to ≤3 lines per the new comment-cap rule (added to CLAUDE.md + auto-memory).
**Where I stopped:** All 7 stochastic + queue tests green on sim release; STM32 release builds clean. Knob inventory HTML (`.scratch/stochastic-knob-ownership.html`) reflects the post-refactor contract — Loop column tags each knob Rhythm or Melody, Pattern shape section holds First / Size / Rotate, Slide / Legato / Gate Length / Burst Pitch rows updated. Test file `TestStochasticCacheParity.cpp` rewritten to assert slot-keyed contract (`slot_keyed_cache_is_first_independent`, removed slide/legato propagate-from-event assertions).
**Next action:** Hardware-flash and verify audibly: (1) move First / Size mid-cycle — slot identity should be stable; (2) NewR — rhythm shifts, melody unchanged; (3) NewM — melody shifts, octave drift resets to 0; (4) move Legato / Slide knobs in Loop — picks recall deterministically; (5) reset-measure preempting mid-cycle — jump / sleep / mutate now also fire (not just patience).
**Branch:** feat/stochastic-seed-log
**Reference:** `.tasks/stochastic-track-port/PHASE17-SEED-DELTA.md` (drafted, next planned cleanup pass — drop dead event fields, BurstPitch rename, mutate redesign), `.tasks/stochastic-track-port/PHASE15-PITCH-MATH-REVIEW.md` (Slide score-based approach captured for later), `.scratch/stochastic-knob-ownership.html` (current knob inventory, single source of truth for the seed/domain contract)

## ⚪ stability-fixes — Narrow crash/corruption fixes from adversarial reviews
**Status:** ready — Modulator/Generator fixes captured; Scope/CV Router/Bus recommendations added.
**Where I stopped:** Audits found four initial stability fixes plus CV Router physical-output staleness, bus last-writer ambiguity, bus shaper stale-state risk, and CvRoute getter hardening.
**Next action:** Fix CV Router output ordering first, then implement the Modulator/Generator crash/corruption fixes and add bus writer observability/priority.
**Depends on:** nothing
**Branch:** TBD
**Reference:** `.tasks/stability-fixes.md`

## 🟡 resource-optimization — RAM & Flash budget recovery
**Status:** paused — baseline recorded; safe wins exhausted; struct-packing only remaining.
**Where I stopped:** Current build is `.data=6,320`, `.bss=113,640`, `.ccmram_bss=54,096`; MonitorPage shows `Track=9560`, `NoteTrack=9544`, `CurveTrack=9480`, `Model=88072`.
**Next action:** Research Teletype file-load backup transaction semantics; USB/FS DirBuf already dead (FF_USE_LFN=0), remaining safe win ~100-300 B struct packing only; LCD packed Canvas (D-A) confirmed no-go; P13/LCD D-B remain future/last-resort research.
**Depends on:** nothing
**Branch:** refactor/resouce-optimization

## 🟡 sim-project-io — Desktop editor foundation: simulator load/save HW projects via FileManager
**Status:** paused
**Where I stopped:** Architecture mapped. Two I/O paths identified (direct std::fstream vs FileManager→FatFs→sdcard.iso). Full plan written at `.tasks/sim-project-io/PLAN.md`.
**Next action:** Step 1 — generate `sdcard.iso` FAT disk image for the virtual SD card
**Depends on:** nothing
**Branch:** TBD

---

## 🟡 core-architecture-optimization — Research XFORMER core mechanics after expansion beyond original Note/Curve Performer
**Status:** paused/reference — research and decision artifacts only, not an implementation queue.
**Where I stopped:** Source probes and decision tables now say RoutingEngine compaction is the only current architecture-adjacent RAM implementation; model/container pool replacement is no-go unless product semantics change.
**Next action:** Keep docs current while implementing `resource-optimization`; use `model-pool-decision-table.md` and `routingengine-refactor-phased-plan.md` as decision references.
**Depends on:** resource-optimization (for baseline measurements)
**Branch:** refactor/resouce-optimization

---

## 🟡 teletype-runtime-architecture — Clarify Teletype VM/slot/runtime ownership before global runtime work
**Status:** paused — Phase 0-4 hardware-verified; two persistence contracts are now implemented.
**Where I stopped:** Phase 4 verified: active-clip-only text save/load, S1-S3 rollback transaction, inactive clip untouched, project save/load OK, `.data+bss` reduced by 1,136 B.
**Next action:** Post-Phase-4 research: decide whether further transaction-buffer reduction or `write()` redundancy cleanup is worth doing.
**Depends on:** resource-optimization (for RAM gates), teletype file transaction semantics
**Branch:** refactor/resouce-optimization

---

## 🟡 teletype-cv-source-combiner — Explicit raw/value-domain CV source pipeline for Teletype outputs
**Status:** paused — task and first implementation plan captured; no code started.
**Where I stopped:** Rejected Telex VCA semantics; first implementation uses explicit raw source arbitration with V0 priority law `ENV > GEODE > LFO > CV`.
**Next action:** If resumed, start Phase 1 in `.tasks/teletype-cv-source-combiner/plan.md`: add per-output source cache without behavior change.
**Depends on:** none; Teletype runtime Phase 4 is hardware-verified
**Branch:** refactor/resouce-optimization

---

## 🟡 teletype-edit-page — Build TeletypeEditPage as multi-mode config page
**Status:** paused
**Where I stopped:** Design finalized — 4-mode ListPage (INPUT/OUTPUT/CV/TIMING) with 4 new ListModels. LayoutPage stays untouched.
**Next action:** Create `TeletypeInputListModel.h`, first of 4 ListModel files
**Depends on:** resource-optimization (needs RAM headroom)
**Branch:** TBD

---

## 🟡 launchpad-track-port — Extend Launchpad controller to all 5 grid-editable track types + Vinx/Modulove enhancements
**Status:** paused
**Where I stopped:** Comprehensive research done across all forks. Track port plan corrected (MidiCv + Teletype removed). Vinx/Modulove LP improvements identified.
**Next action:** Split LaunchpadController.cpp into per-track files, then begin Phase 1: NoteTrack fixes + Foundation (LP Style / LP Note Style settings)
**Depends on:** indexed-sequence-macro-refactor (Phase 4: Macro Grid v2 for Indexed)
**Branch:** TBD

---

## ⚪ indexed-sequence-macro-refactor — Extract macro logic into IndexedSequence model
**Status:** ready — not started
**Where I stopped:** Identified ~700 lines of macro logic in `IndexedSequenceEditPage.cpp:1605-2304` that must move to `IndexedSequence` model methods. 20 macros across rhythm, waveform, melodic, and duration categories.
**Next action:** Read macro code, catalog functions, design model API (individual methods vs. enum dispatch)
**Depends on:** nothing
**Blocks:** launchpad-track-port Phase 4 (Macro Grid v2 for Indexed)
**Branch:** TBD

---

## 🟡 performer-improvements — Non-Launchpad improvements from VinxScorza, Modulove, and Mebitek
**Status:** paused — Phase 1 wired and hardware-verified (6/8 items done); generator task extracted to separate task.
**Where I stopped:** Phase 1 items completed: (1) Quick octave change Step+F1-F5, (2) Double-click Page context menus with 2s auto-close, (3) Short clock pulse 1ms floor, (4-6) PerformerPage mute LEDs + pattern labels + MenuWrap. Generator preview/apply extracted to `generator-preview-apply` task.
**Next action:** Remaining Phase 1: Curve undo restoration. Then generator-preview-apply Phase A.
**Depends on:** resource-optimization (RAM headroom available)
**Branch:** TBD

---

## 🟢 usb-keyboard-function-keys-extraction — Extract duplicated F1-F5 pressFunctionButton dispatch from 17 page keyboard() overrides into BasePage helper
**Status:** done — all phases complete. 18 files refactored (original 17 + GeneratorPage). Build clean.
**Where I stopped:** `BasePage::handleFunctionKeys()` added. Pattern A (11 files), B (5 files), C (2 files) refactored. STM32 release build verified: `.data=6,332`, `.bss=112,552`, `.ccmram_bss=54,804` (net SRAM -1,076 B vs baseline — within linker noise for pure code move).
**Next action:** Merge to master when user confirms.
**Depends on:** nothing (structural refactor, no RAM or behavior change)
**Branch:** TBD

---

## 🟢 global-modulators-v1 — Port Modulove-style global modulators with chaos shapes
**Status:** complete — Phases 1-9 done. Core shapes, output routing, RoutingEngine/CvRoute integration, defaults, rate consistency, documentation. Hardware verified.
**Where I stopped:** Phase 9 (CvRoute modulator inputs) committed. manuals/Modulators.md written. Feature ready for merge to master.
**Next action:** Merge `feat/modulators` to master when user confirms.
**Depends on:** none (RAM gate passed)
**Branch:** feat/modulators

---

## 🟡 route-reordering — Rearranging Routing::Target enum into signal-flow ordering
**Status:** paused — Spec complete; no code started.
**Where I stopped:** Spec written in `reorder-spec.md`. Target ordering by signal-flow agreed. `targetSerialize()` already decouples serialization from enum values.
**Next action:** Update `Routing.h` enum, sentinel values, `isXxxTarget()` checks; then `Routing.cpp` `targetInfos[]` and `targetName()` order.
**Depends on:** nothing (pure refactor, no behavior change)
**Branch:** feat/modulators

---

## 🟡 usb-mouse-to-route — USB mouse axes/buttons as Routing::Source CV inputs
**Status:** paused — design captured; no code started. Gate identified before any feature work. Worktree at `.worktrees/usb-mouse-to-route/`.
**Where I stopped:** Walked the USB-keyboard git history (`6b0e407e` driver lift → `41ade375`/`80dd6d9c`/`b32cf6cb` failed-then-reverted in-driver OLED diagnostics → `82e64080` Engine pump → KeyboardManager extraction → `0d2b0015` mouse rejection). Established the OLED diagnostic rule: nothing inside `usbh_driver_hid.c` hooks or `hid_in_message_handler` may take a FreeRTOS mutex; only `UsbH::process()` post-poll may touch OLED. Mapped source-enum / RoutingEngine plug-in points.
**Next action:** Step 1 in TASK.md — reproduce the mouse-rejection crash on hardware with the rejection at `usbh_driver_hid.c:218-224` removed, observe whether keyboard/Launchpad survive, to establish the failure boundary before designing a fix.
**Depends on:** none (gated on libusbhost mouse-enumeration root cause investigation, which is step 1 of this task itself)
**Branch:** feat/usb-mouse-to-route (from master @ 11b5dae0)
**Reference:** `.tasks/usb-mouse-to-route/TASK.md`

## 🔵 fractal-track-implementation — Parent-material command/rule track (FractalTrack)
**Status:** blocked — design re-anchored 2026-05-22 to parent material + volatile trunk + model-owned command rules; awaits stochastic completion and RAM budget.
**Where I stopped:** Current best contract is now parent motif → section-sampled engine trunk → model rule sequence → output. The captured unit is a Fractal section, not a Performer step or parent event; parent provenance is opaque. Capture is a model rule family (record extent, Replace/Latch/Once, PunchIn, recordTrigger, lock), not hidden engine plumbing or a separate manual recorder phase. Trunk cell contract stores 11-bit CV + 4-bit gate length + valid; trunk is volatile engine state, never serialized.
**Next action:** Finish Phase 0 by validating TASK/DICTIONARY/HTML agreement after the command-rule update, then resume Phase 1 model work with STM32 sizeof probe when RAM budget opens.
**Depends on:** resource-optimization (needs RAM headroom), stochastic-track-port (higher priority, will consume first available RAM)
**Branch:** TBD
**Reference:** `docs/fractal-track-options-comparison.html` (canonical architectural ref), `.tasks/fractal-track-implementation/TASK.md`, `.tasks/fractal-track-implementation/DICTIONARY.md`, `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-17-fractal-track-design.md` (historical spec; superseded by HTML for MVP shape), `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-17-fractal-advanced-research.md`

## 🟢 usb-keyboard-system — Full USB keyboard pipeline (driver, manager, global shortcuts, Teletype shortcuts)
**Status:** done — all 4 phases merged to master
**Where I stopped:** HID driver fixed (dedup, ring buffer, mouse rejected). KeyboardManager extracted. Global shortcuts (Tab context menu, arrow keys, Alt+letter). Teletype shortcuts (F1-F5, Alt+F1-F5, Alt+/, Alt+arrows). Branches: feat/USB-keyboard4, feat/global-keyboard-refactoring (merged).
**Components:** usb-hid-implementation, usb-keyboard-manager-refactor, performer-keyboard-shortcuts, teletype-keyboard-shortcuts

---

## 🟢 teletype-file-reliability — Fix real Teletype file saving/loading bugs
**Status:** done — all 3 phases complete, merged to master
**Where I stopped:** Phases 0-2 merged. Follow-on on master: script files show project name in slot picker (`8a829819`), USB keyboard text input for NAME fields (`2f4f38dc`).
**Branch:** fix/teletype-files (stale, can delete)

---

## 🟡 orca-mvp — Port Orca esolang to Performer as new track type
**Status:** paused
**Where I stopped:** Research phase complete. All reference codebases cloned to `temp-ref/` (C, Lua, Arduino C++). RAM container gates identified: `NoteTrack=9544 B`, `TeletypeTrackEngine=912 B`. Next step is designing fixed-grid `OrcaTrack` model that fits under the container gate.
**Next action:** Prototype `OrcaTrack` model with fixed grid size (e.g., 16×16 or 32×16) and measure `sizeof(OrcaTrack)` in STM32 release build to verify it stays ≤ `NoteTrack`.
**Depends on:** resource-optimization (needs RAM headroom), teletype-runtime-architecture (pattern slot pattern to follow)
**Branch:** TBD
