## Algorithm Backup Completed

All 21 TuesdayTrack algorithms have been successfully backed up to separate files in the `Algo-backup/` directory:

- **TEST** (Algorithm 0) - Backup created
- **TRITRANCE** (Algorithm 1) - Backup created  
- **STOMPER** (Algorithm 2) - Backup created
- **MARKOV** (Algorithm 3) - Backup created
- **CHIPARP** (Algorithm 4) - Backup created
- **GOACID** (Algorithm 5) - Backup created
- **SNH** (Algorithm 6) - Backup created
- **WOBBLE** (Algorithm 7) - Backup created
- **TECHNO** (Algorithm 8) - Backup created
- **FUNK** (Algorithm 9) - Backup created
- **DRONE** (Algorithm 10) - Backup created
- **PHASE** (Algorithm 11) - Backup created
- **RAGA** (Algorithm 12) - Backup created
- **AMBIENT** (Algorithm 13) - Backup created
- **ACID** (Algorithm 14) - Backup created
- **DRILL** (Algorithm 15) - Backup created
- **MINIMAL** (Algorithm 16) - Backup created
- **KRAFT** (Algorithm 17) - Backup created
- **APHEX** (Algorithm 18) - Backup created
- **AUTECHRE** (Algorithm 19) - Backup created
- **STEPWAVE** (Algorithm 20) - Backup created

## Directory Structure
- All backup files stored in `/Algo-backup/` directory
- Each algorithm has its own backup file named `[ALGORITHM_NAME]_Algorithm_Backup.cpp`
- README.md provides navigation index for all algorithms

## Purpose
- Preservation of original algorithm implementations for future reference
- Enable safe refactoring of TuesdayTrackEngine code
- Support for selective algorithm modifications without losing original implementations
