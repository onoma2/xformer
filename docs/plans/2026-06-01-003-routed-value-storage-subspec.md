# Sub-spec: routed value storage (Routable redesign)

Sub-spec of the routing mod-matrix overhaul
(`2026-05-31-002-routing-mod-matrix-overhaul-plan.md`). Scopes one decision the
overhaul forces but the parent plan does not settle: **where a routed value
lives, and whether routing replaces or modulates the base.**

---

## Problem (confirmed in code)

A routable param is a `Routable<T>` — a union of `{ base, routed }` (Routing.h
`template Routable`). For **sequence-level** params it lives inside each
`Sequence`, and a track owns `CONFIG_PATTERN_COUNT + CONFIG_SNAPSHOT_COUNT` = 17
sequences (Config.h:51-52; `NoteTrack::NoteSequenceArray`).

NoteSequence carries 7 such fields (`_scale,_rootNote,_divisor,_clockMultiplier,
_runMode,_firstStep,_lastStep`, NoteSequence.h:794-805); CurveSequence carries 12.

Two redundancies result:

1. **Storage.** The `routed` half exists ×17 per track per param. A routed value
   is logically *one per track* — `Routing::writeTarget` loops all 17 patterns
   (`for patternIndex < CONFIG_PATTERN_COUNT: sequence(p).writeRouted(...)`,
   Routing.cpp) writing the **same** value, so the 17 routed slots are forced
   equal. Order ~1–2 KB of routed slots that are identical copies when active,
   multiplied through the 8-track container.

2. **CPU.** The per-pattern copy loop runs on every routing recompute, writing
   one value into 17 places.

3. **Semantics.** `get(isRouted())` returns base **or** routed — mutually
   exclusive. A live route **replaces** base; the per-pattern base is dead while
   routed. So routing a per-pattern param flattens all 17 patterns to one value,
   which makes the per-pattern storage of that param pointless precisely when it
   is being driven.

Root cause: the `routed` slot is **transient modulation state stored as
per-pattern model data.** Base is saved project data and legitimately differs per
pattern (pattern 1 C-major, pattern 2 D-minor); the routed value is a single live
per-track route output that has no reason to be per-pattern.

### Forward-designed base-only fields (Stochastic, PhaseFlux)

Not every routed target has a `routed` slot, and that is **deliberate**.
**Stochastic Scale/RootNote/Divisor and PhaseFlux Scale/RootNote are plain base
fields** (`int8_t _scale` etc., StochasticSequence.h:28-42, PhaseFluxSequence.h:341-353)
— intentionally left out of the `Routable` convention because these types were
designed anticipating this overhaul: they are *already* in the target shape
(base-only), waiting for the per-track override table rather than carrying the
redundant per-pattern `routed` half.

Consequence for now: `writeTarget` routes them by writing **base** on all patterns
(`setScale(intValue)` with no routed flag). That is the **interim** — the override
table is exactly what lets these route without touching base. (Open: until the
override lands, a route active at save time writes the value into the serialized
base; flag whether that interim needs a guard, or whether these targets simply do
not go live until the table exists.)

This is why the migration inventory below classifies by **current storage**, built
from `writeTarget` + every `writeRouted` — a `Routable<>` scan would miss the
base-only fields entirely.

---

## Proposed shape

- `Sequence` keeps **base only** (`int8_t _scale` instead of
  `Routable<int8_t> _scale`).
- The **routed value lives once per `(track, paramKey)`** in a model-owned
  transient override table — **not serialized** (it is modulation, not project
  data). See the ownership section below for owner/lifetime/concurrency.
- Read combines base + the live route value at access time.
- The per-pattern copy loop is deleted; the ×17 routed storage is dropped.

This is independent of the replace-vs-modulate choice below: **both** combine
rules store the 17 bases (already present) + one per-track value, and both kill
the loop and the duplication.

---

## Combine semantics — Absolute vs Modulate (owner decision)

> **Unified model (authoritative — parent R15/R16).** Both combines are **base-anchored** with
> **one signed coefficient `d`, no `min/max` window**: `out = clamp(base + d·u·range)`. Modulate
> uses centered source `u=(s−0.5)·2` (neutral at center); Absolute uses raw source `u=s` (sweep
> from base, width `d`). The override table stores the additive `delta`; read = `clamp(base+delta)`.
> The per-param detail below (which params modulate, param spans, center-preserving shapers) still
> holds; the old "Absolute = replace via window" framing is superseded by the anchored model.

Per-param, via a `RouteParam::Flag` (`Modulate` vs `Absolute`):

- **Absolute.** `u = raw source`; `out = clamp(base + d·s·range)` — base-anchored sweep, `d` the
  travel span. (Old full-range replace = `base` at range floor, `d`=100%.)
- **Modulate.** `u = centered source`; `out = clamp(base + d·(s−0.5)·2·range)` — bipolar around
  base, neutral at source-center. Per-pattern base stays meaningful while routed.

The existing ranges already sort this: several params are **already bipolar**
(designed as modulators, implemented as replace), others are absolute indices.

### Depth-and-range contract (resolves review finding 1)

There is no per-route window. Each param declares an intrinsic **range** (its span,
registry); the route's single signed **`d`** scales it. The delta is `d · u · range`
(`u` = source-form per combine), so a Modulate param is neutral at source-center by
construction and an Absolute param travels `d·range` from base. `range` values come
from `targetInfos` (shown as min..max; the half-span feeds bipolar params):

| Param | Storage | targetInfos range | Combine | `d`-range | clamp |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Octave | Track Routable | -10..10 | **Modulate** | ±d·range | valid octave |
| Transpose | Track Routable | -60..60 | **Modulate** | ±d·range | pitch range |
| Offset (Curve) | Routable | -500..500 | **Modulate** | ±d·range | value range |
| Rotate | Routable | -64..64 | **Modulate** | ±d·range | step count |
| Gate/Retrig/Length/Note/Shape Bias | Routable | -8..8 | **Modulate** | ±d·range | bias range |
| SlideTime | Routable | 0..100 | Absolute | d·range from base | — |
| Divisor | Seq Routable | 1..768 | Absolute | d·range from base | — |
| ClockMult | Seq Routable | 50..150 | Absolute (additive sweep) | d·range from base | — |
| Scale / RootNote | Routable (Note/Curve) / base-only (Stoch, PF) | 0..23 / 0..11 | Absolute (index) | d·range from base | — |
| RunMode | Seq Routable | 0..5 enum | Absolute | d·range from base | — |
| FirstStep / LastStep | Seq Routable | 0..63 | Absolute | d·range from base | — |
| Mute / Pattern / Fill | PlayState | — | Absolute | d·range from base | — |

### Modulate neutral contract (resolves review finding 2 — neutral is enforceable)

A free min..max pair (the deleted legacy control) could not guarantee neutral — a
stored `+1..+3` makes source 0.5 produce `+2`, constant drift. The unified model has
no such pair; a Modulate route carries only the **single signed `d`**, and the offset is

```
offset = d * (source_centered)        // source_centered ∈ [-1, +1], 0.5 source → 0
read   = clamp(base + offset, hardMin, hardMax)
```

where `source_centered ∈ [-1,+1]` is the **post-shaper** source re-centered, and the
shaper must be **center-preserving** (maps source-center → its own center) for neutral
to hold. Two user knobs otherwise break it, both constrained on Modulate routes:

- **Bias** — `shaped = 0.5 + (src-0.5)*depth + bias` (RoutingEngine) applies a DC
  shift before the map, so `bias≠0` moves center off-neutral. A Modulate route carries
  **`d` only — no additive `biasPct`** (`depthPct` folds into `d`).
- **Shaper** — must map center→center. The criterion is **center-preservation, not
  statelessness** (Crease is stateless yet maps 0.5→1.0). Classification of every
  `Routing::Shaper` under Modulate (verified at bias=0):

| Shaper | Center (0.5) → | Modulate |
|---|---|---|
| None | 0.5 (identity) | **allow** |
| TriangleFold | 0.5 (`x=0 → folded 0`) | **allow** |
| Crease | **1.0** (`0.5 ≤ threshold` adds +0.5) | deny — not center-preserving |
| Location | history (integrator) | deny — stateful |
| Envelope | history (→0) | deny — stateful |
| FrequencyFollower | history (`freqAcc/sign/hold`) | deny — stateful |
| Activity | history | deny — stateful |
| ProgressiveDivider | history | deny — stateful |
| VcaNext | 0.5 (`0.5+(src-0.5)*neighbor`); neighbor-dependent away from center | deny — **separate policy**, see below |

Two deny reasons, kept distinct:
- **Fails center-preservation** → Crease (0.5→1.0) and all stateful shapers
  (Location, Envelope, FrequencyFollower, Activity, ProgressiveDivider — output
  depends on prior samples, so center is not fixed).
- **Passes center-preservation but denied by policy** → VcaNext *is* center-preserving
  (center → 0.5), but it is neighbor-route-dependent and is being extracted into the
  explicit `scaleSource` field (parent R6), so it does not exist as a Modulate shaper.

Allowed Modulate shapers: **None, TriangleFold**. A denied shaper on a Modulate route
is rejected at edit (or opt-in with the neutral guarantee explicitly waived).

With bias excluded and the shaper center-preserving, source-center → exactly 0 offset
is provable. The UI for a Modulate route edits one depth value, no min..max, no bias —
so an asymmetric "+1..+3" window is unrepresentable.

The bipolar absolute ranges (Octave -10..10, Transpose -60..60, biases -8..8) inform
`d`'s default magnitude (e.g. half-range), but Modulate's stored form is `d`, not the
pair. **Owner decision is the column assignment** (which params modulate); the
representation and per-param flag are settled. Clean-break format (parent R9) means
no legacy routes to migrate, so replace→modulate is free at load.

Tests required: source 0.5 → exactly base for every Modulate param **and for each
allowed shaper** (None, TriangleFold); full +d and −d at base hard min/max (clamp
holds); negative `d` inverts polarity; a denied shaper (e.g. FrequencyFollower,
Crease) cannot be set on a Modulate route; an asymmetric window cannot be constructed.

## Routed-value ownership — DECIDED: model-owned transient override table (resolves finding 2)

The live routed value lives in a **per-track override table in the Model, not
serialized** — chosen over an engine routed-value service because it preserves the
current layering (UI reads model getters only; no model→engine call) and matches
where routed data lives today (the `Routable.routed` slot is already model RAM the
engine writes).

- **Owner:** the Model. One transient (non-serialized) per-track table keyed by
  `paramKey`, sized to the routable-param count. Replaces the per-pattern `routed`
  half and the Stochastic base-mutation.
- **Writer:** the engine apply path (single-pass recompute), exactly where
  `writeTarget` writes today. Values are word-sized scalars → same write/read
  concurrency as today's `Routable.routed`; no new lock. Structural changes already
  occur under the engine suspend/lock.
- **Active-route gating:** the existing active-route bit (`isRouted`, currently a
  static set) selects override-vs-base at read; unchanged in kind.
- **Invalidation:** cleared on **track-mode change** (the `updateTrackSetups`
  rebuild — the new type has different params) and on **route deactivation/reconfig**
  (clear the param's override + active bit, mirroring the trigger `gateMask` re-arm).
- **Inactive default:** no active route → getter returns base. No stale read because
  the active bit gates it.

This keeps the model the single read API for UI, file, and clipboard paths.

## Migration inventory (replaces blast-radius; resolves finding 3)

**Storage kind is per `(param × track type)`, not per Target** — the flat enum
cannot be classified once. `Scale` is sequence-`Routable` in Note/Curve but a plain
base field in Stochastic/PhaseFlux; `Octave` is track-`Routable` in Note but
absent in MidiCv. So the inventory is **per type**, built from `writeTarget` + every
`writeRouted` + the `Routable<>`/plain field declarations. This per-type-divergence
is itself the argument for per-type tables.

### Storage kinds (the axis)

| Kind | Storage today | This spec |
|---|---|---|
| **S** Sequence-level `Routable<T>` | `{base,routed}` ×17 patterns | drop routed half + copy loop; base→plain; route via override (**the dedup win**) |
| **T** Track-level `Routable<T>` | `{base,routed}` ×1 | base→plain + override; uniform read path (not a RAM win) |
| **P** Project-global `Routable<T>` | `{base,routed}` ×1 (Project / CvRoute) | base→plain + override (scalar) |
| **B** Plain base field, no routed slot | base only | add override; stop the interim base-write; no field surgery |
| **D** `Routable` but undispatched (dead slot) | `{base,routed}`, routed never written | add dispatch via override, or force active-bit off; do not migrate as normal S |
| **X** PlayState transport | live `TrackState`, no base/routed | unchanged — action-like, writes live transport directly |
| **I** Inlet | engine per-track CV bus | parent overhaul inlet path (out of scope) |
| **G** Engine action / trigger | none | done — `RouteState.gateMask` |
| **R** Engine rail (Bus) | engine-owned CV | engine `setBusCv` (out of scope) |

In scope for the override table: **S, T, P, B, D**. Untouched: X, I, G, R.

### Per-type / global enumeration (every routed Target, exactly once per type)

**Global (type-independent):**
- **P** — Tempo, Swing, CvRouteScan, CvRouteRoute (`_tempo`,`_swing` Project; `_scan`,`_route` CvRoute)
- **X** — Mute, Fill, FillAmount, Pattern (PlayState `TrackState`)
- **G** — Play, PlayToggle, Record, RecordToggle, TapTempo, Reset (no model storage; edge/action)
- **R** — BusCv1, BusCv2, BusCv3, BusCv4
- **T** (universal Track base) — CvOutputRotate, GateOutputRotate, **Run** (`_runGate` `Routable`, level-gate — has T storage, so it migrates with T) (`Track.h`)

**Per track type** (S = sequence Routable, T = track Routable, B = base-only, I = inlet):

| Type | S (sequence Routable) | T (track Routable) | B (base-only) | I (inlet) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Note | Scale,RootNote,Divisor,ClockMult,RunMode,FirstStep,LastStep | SlideTime,Octave,Transpose,Rotate,Gate/Retrig/Length/Note ProbBias | — | — |
| Curve | Divisor,ClockMult,RunMode,FirstStep,LastStep,WavefolderFold,WavefolderGain,DjFilter,ChaosAmount,ChaosRate,ChaosParam1,ChaosParam2 | SlideTime,Offset,Rotate,Shape/Gate ProbBias,CurveRate | — | — |
| MidiCv | — | SlideTime,Transpose | — | — |
| Tuesday | Algorithm,Flow,Ornament,Power,Glide,Trill,StepTrill,Octave,Transpose,Divisor,ClockMult,Rotate,GateLength,GateOffset | — | — | — |
| DiscreteMap | ClockMult,SlewTime | Octave,Transpose,SlideTime,Offset | RangeHigh,RangeLow (`float`) | Input,Scanner,Sync |
| Indexed | ClockMult,RunMode,RootNote,FirstStep | Octave,Transpose,SlideTime | — | A, B (+borrows DiscreteMapSync) |
| Stochastic | ClockMult,MaskRhythm,GateLength,Tilt,Burst,Rotate,Complexity,Contour,NoteDuration,Variation,Rest,Slide,Sleep,PatienceRhythm,Mutate,Jump (16, dispatched) | Octave,Transpose,SlideTime | **Scale,RootNote,Divisor** (base-write via `writeTarget`) | — |
| PhaseFlux | Divisor,ClockMult (dispatched, routed) | Octave,Transpose,SlideTime | **Scale,RootNote** (base-write via `writeRouted`) | — |

**Dead routed slot (own category — Routable but undispatched):**
- **Stochastic Feel** — `_feel` is `Routable<uint8_t>` and `feel()` reads
  `_feel.get(isRouted(StochasticFeel))`, but `StochasticSequence::writeRouted` has
  **no Feel case**. The target routes (the active bit is set) yet nothing writes the
  routed slot — a read-but-never-written dead route. This is the `StochasticFeel`
  dead-route the parent plan cites as a motivating bug. The migration must either add
  the dispatch or treat it as dormant with the active bit forced off — not list it as
  a normal S param.

Notes (corrected from a complete read of every `writeRouted`, incl. inline-`.h`):
- Stochastic's dispatched S set is 16 params; Scale/RootNote/Divisor are B
  (base-mutating via `writeTarget`'s Stochastic arm); Feel is the dead slot above.
- PhaseFlux `writeRouted` (`PhaseFluxSequence.h:572`) **is** dispatched, not dormant:
  Divisor/ClockMult routed (S), Scale/RootNote base-write (B). Same base-corruption
  path as Stochastic for Scale/RootNote.
- Indexed borrowing `DiscreteMapSync` is the cross-type drift the parent plan removes (R13).

For each S/T/P/B entry the implementation records, before changing storage:
active-route read path, edit guard, serialization, and owner. Fits the parent
overhaul's clean-break window; reshapes what `Routable` *is* rather than adding a unit.
