 Page+Step 5: Generators (Threshold Patterns)

  - M-CLUSTER: Random clumping - tight bunches with gaps

  Page+Step 6: Note Patterns (Note Index)
- ACT: Evenly distribute all active stages (Rise/Fall/Both)
  - RISE: Evenly distribute only Rise stages
  - FALL: Evenly distribute only Fall stages
  - BOTH: Evenly distribute only Both stages
  - NORM: Normalize threshold spacing (equal gaps)



  Page+Step 6: Transform
 - FLIP: Cycle directions (Rise→Fall→Both→Off→Rise)
  - T-MIRR: Mirror thresholds around midpoint
  - T-REV: Reverse threshold order
  - N-MIRR: Mirror note indices
  - N-REV: Reverse note order


   Page+Step 15: 

  Remove even and flip Quick Edit. Leave Piano and Guitar Quick edit as is

  Page+Step 5: Rhythm Generators

  - EUCL: Euclidean rhythm (F1: steps, F2: pulses, F3: rotation)
  - CLAVE: Classic patterns (Son/Rumba/Bossa/Bembe)
  - TUPLET: Subdivide into tuplets (F1: 3/5/7)
  - POLY: Polyrhythmic subdivision
  - M-RHY: Random generative rhythm

  Page+Step 6: Waveforms ()
  - D-LOG: Duration logarithmic curve
  - D-EXP: Duration exponential curve
  - D-TRI: Duration triangle (accel→decel)



  Page+Step 7: Transforms

  Page+Step 15: Duration & Transform

- REV: Reverse step order
  - MIRR: Mirror around midpoint
- Rev-D: reverse durations only
- mirror duration only
