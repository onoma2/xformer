# Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical planning and design documents for features that have been **fully implemented** and are now documented in the main project documentation.

## Why These Are Archived

These documents were valuable during the development process but are no longer needed for ongoing work. They are preserved here for historical reference and to understand the evolution of implemented features.
